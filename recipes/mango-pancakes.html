        <h2>Description</h2>

        <p>Allegedly, everyone's favorite at dim sum. A light <s>desert</s> dessert that tastes like what you'd expect. Fresh mango and cream wrapped around by a thin pale yellow crepe that looks like cheeze.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <h3>The Crepe</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup milk, <em>full fat</em></li>
            <li>&frac13; cup plain flour <em>(all-purpose flour)</em></li>
            <li>&frac14; cup cornflour / cornstarch</li>
            <li>&frac14; cup icing sugar / powdered sugar <em>(all-purpose sugar)</em></li>
            <li>3 large eggs <em>(55-60g/20oz each)</em></li>
            <li>&frac14; teaspoon yellow food coloring <em>(to get that cheeze look)</em></li>
            <li>Canola oil spray</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Mango</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>2 large ripe mangoes, <em>skin peeled with a knife, cut into 10 to 12 pieces (7 x 2.5 x 1cm, 3 x 1 x &half;) (because, yeah, you're going to definitely measure that stuff)</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>The Cream</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>&frac34; cup thiccened/heavy cream, <em>fridge cold</em></li>
            <li>3 tablespoon icing sugar / powdered sugar <em>(double the sugar, double the fall)</em></li>
            <li>&half; teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>

        <h3>Pancake:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Batter - </strong> Place the milk in a bowl. Sift the flour, cornflour and icing sugar in then whisk until lump free. Add eggs and food coloring, whisk until combined. It will be a very thin, watery batter.</li>
            <li><strong>Refrigerate</strong> for 1 hour. <em>(Patience, young one. You'll get your sugar high soon enough.)</em></li>
            <li><strong>Measure batter - </strong> After one game of league, give the batter a mix (to stir in flour settled at bottom) then measure out 45 ml (3 tbsp) of crepe batter,.</li>
            <li><strong>Non-stick pan -</strong> Use an 18cm/7" non-stick pan. Spray lightly with oil then heat over a medium low stove.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook pancake -</strong> Pour the batter into the middle - it should sizzle very lightly - then swirl to cover the base in a thin layer. Cook for 45 seconds to 1 minute or until the middle is set to touch. About halfway through cooking, start loosening the edges with a rubber spatula to ensure it flips out easily.</li>
            <li><strong>Flip</strong> the crepe out upside down onto a large cutting board. <storng>GOAL:</storng> Surface is set, underside has no golden patches. Adjust heat as needed.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook more!</strong> Spray pan with oil then continue cooking the pancakes. You can flip them out on top of each other.</li>
            <li><strong>Cool (yeah, you are)- </strong> Full cool the crepes for 1 hour before using. <em>(Again, patience...)</em></li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Assembling:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cream -</strong> Just before assembling, place the cream, icing sugar and vanilla in a cold bowl and beat until stiff (about 2 minutes on speed 8 of a 10 speed hand mixer).</li>
            <li><strong>Filling -</strong> Place a crepe on a work surface so the side that was in contact with the pan is facing up. Spread 1cm/1/3" thicc layer of cream one-third of the way up the pancake, in the shapae of a piece of mang. Top with mango.</li>
            <li><strong>Roll,</strong> burrito style, ending with the seam-side down. Repeat with remaining pancakes.</li>
            <li><strong>Serve immediately!</strong> Mango pancakes wait for no one!</li>
        </ol>
